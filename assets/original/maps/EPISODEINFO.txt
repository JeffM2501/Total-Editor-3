LOG ENTRY 000:
IT HAS BEEN 5 YEARS SINCE THE FIRST WRAITH INVASION.
OUR KIND HAS DISCOVERED THE WRAITH'S ORIGIN:SATURN.
YES, I KNOW IT'S A GAS PLANET. I DON'T GET IT EITHER.
WE'VE SET UP A SPACE STATION TO INVESTIGATE.
AND SOMEONE GOT THE BRIGHT IDEA TO DO GENETIC
EXPERIMENTS ON THE WRAITHS. YOU CAN TELL HOW THAT
TURNED OUT. ANYWAY, THOSE IMBECILES COME CRYING
TO ME TO SAVE THEM, AGAIN, SO LET'S HOPE I CAN MAKE
IT TO THE ROCKET WITH ALL MY LIMBS INTACT. I'M GOING
TO NEED THEM.

THE TOWERING MECHA LIES IN A SMOLDERING HEAP AT MY
FEET. WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT THING SUPPOSED TO 
BE, ANYWAY? SOME SORT OF ILLUMINATI TANK?
I ARRIVED JUST IN TIME FOR ME TO GET ON THE ROCKET
TO THE ACUMEN ENGINEERING SPACE STATION.
THERE I WILL CONDUCT A VERY IMPORTANT EXPERIMENT:
CAN WRAITHS BREATH WHILE BEING STRANGLED BY YOURS
TRULY?

LOG ENTRY 002:
WELL, I MADE IT TO THE SPACE STATION.
MAN, IT'S REALLY HARD TO BREATH IN HERE.
ANYWAY, THE SCIENTISTS WARNED ME THAT THEIR
GENETICALLY MODIFIED WRAITHS ARE ON THE LOOSE.
WHOOPEE. ONE OF THEM ALSO ADDED THAT THEY 
MAY HAVE ROCKET LAUNCHERS ATTACHED TO THEIR
SHOULDERS AND THAT IT DEFINITELY WASN'T HIS IDEA.

I'M PRETTY SURE IT WAS HIS IDEA.

LOG ENTRY 003:
IN ITS DYING BREATH,
THE MUTANT SPOKE TO ME IN MY MIND.
IT TOLD ME THAT THE WRAITHS ARE NOT BORN NATURALLY,
AND THAT THEY ARE ALL BROUGHT TO LIFE BY GOD TO WIPE
OUT HUMANITY.AS ITS VOICE FADED,IT REVEALED TO ME 
THAT THE WRAITHS DO NOT LIVE ON SATURN.RATHER, THERE
IS A PORTAL TO THEIR PLANET ON SATURN,AND OUR KIND
HAD ALREADY TRAVELLED THERE ONCE.

ANYWAY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF "GOD" IT'S TALKING
ABOUT, BUT I'M EITHER GOING TO DIE ON EARTH WHEN
THE WRAITHS INEVITABLY TAKE OVER, OR I'M GOING TO
DIE FIGHTING A GOD TO THE DEATH. I THINK I'LL CHOOSE
THE LEAST BORING OPTION.

HOW DOES THAT EVEN WORK!?
HOW AM I STILL ALIVE?

WELL, I'M STILL ALIVE. WHOOP DE DOO.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS MAY MEAN FOR THE FUTURE.
IS THE UNIVERSE JUST GOING TO...DISAPPEAR? IF NOT,
WHO THE HECK'S GONNA RUN THIS PLACE? ME? I'M NOT
TOO FIT TO BE A GODDESS, HONESTLY. IT'S JUST NOT
MY STYLE...I'M JUST GONNA GO HOME NOW.
