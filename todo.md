[x] Switching between list mode and grid mode in picker
[x] Test shape with multiple materials
[x] Make cylinder align flatly with panels
[x] Add corner wedges
[x] Basic directional lighting
[x] Decide on better hotkeys for picking
[x] Tile copy (Copy texture or shape or both?)
[x] Undo/Redo!! (That was difficult)
[x] Rectangle fill
[x] Fix the scroll bar bug

[x] Make editormode take care of hide/reveal layers.
[x] Status message for hiding / revealing layers
[x] Make shape picking capture orientation
[x] Brush copying (Be careful about resize)
[x] Embed font and shaders
[x] Implement View menu
[x] Modal windows
[x] Implement New Map
[x] Extract tile grid from picker mode.
[x] Fix odd map size problems

[x] Flip tiles vertically?
[x] Preview mode
[x] Entity placement & configuration
[x] Blank cursor bug after texture screen
[x] File operations, .TI3
[x] Import TI2 (Converter written as separate application)
[x] Optimize entity rendering
[x] Allow transparency with instancedMaterial?
[x] Are you sure you want to exit?
[x] Asset path changing
[x] Settings menu
[x] Save and load settings
[x] Information
[x] Aggregate mesh generation (For displaying in preview mode)
[x] Make preview mesh shaded
[x] Instead of flipping tiles, allow them to be rotated on pitch.
[x] Export preview mesh as GLTF
[x] GLTF Export Dialog and File Browser
[x] Test Windows OS
[x] Save GLTF export setting
[x] Make GLTF texture paths relative to the file
[x] Only load used textures ~~and shapes~~ into Assets
[x] When saving, list only the used textures and shapes.
[ ] Update instructions
# Future prospects
[ ] Shapes with empty UVs get automatically mapped (Allows for rotation and flipping without distorting texture mapping)
[ ] Add .glb export, embedding textures in file.
[ ] Optimize exported geometry by removing redundant faces.
[ ] Consider replacing RayGUI with ImGUI
[ ] Consider giving entities billboard / model viewing modes
